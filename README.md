# Welcome to Simple Basket!

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Irwin Ian, and I'm thrilled to present **SimpleBasket**, a simple sample e-commerce app I've crafted using a modern tech stack:

 - **Core:** ReactJS for dynamic UI, NextJS for server-side rendering, Redux toolkit for efficient state management, and Lodash for powerful data manipulation and utility functions.

 - **Style & Design:** Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and the versatile Shadcn/ui component library.
 - **Data:** "dummyjson" for providing sample API data, allowing for seamless exploration of the app's features.

### ToDo:

 - Create authentication page using AuthJS
 - Create admin account access features such as product CRUD
